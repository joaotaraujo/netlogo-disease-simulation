# Netlogo Disease Simulation

About
-----
In November 2015 there was the biggest socio-environmental catastrophe in the history of Brazil caused by the collapse of the Barragem do Fund√£o, owned by the mining company Samarco, controlled by the companies BHP Billiton and Vale S.A, in the city of Mariana, in Minas Gerais.
Sudden changes in the environment impact the health of animals, including monkeys, which due to lack of food become more susceptible to diseases, such as yellow fever, which can be transmitted to humans through a vector mosquito.
This work aims to model the problem through a multi-agent environment (netLogo), in order to represent how yellow fever is disseminated through the relationships between food availability, the presence of monkeys, mosquitoes and humans in an area similar to the region of Minas Gerais.
